Description: Some fasta files contain all chromosomes from one genomeï¼Œ
  sometimes users have to split these chromosomes into different 
  files according to their chromosome number.The 'msqchr' can help 
  to handle this, so that the specific chromosome 'fasta' file can 
  be used for downstream analysis like motif finding.
