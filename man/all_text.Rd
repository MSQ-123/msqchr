\description{
A downsampled dataset containing the hg19 chromosome sequence
from the hg19 blacklist.
}
\details{
The hg19 blacklist is obtained from the supplementary
dataset from the referenced article, and then it is sent to
the UCSC Table Browser for obtaining the corresponding
sequence file. The sequence file is processed with
replace_all_text function to simplify the fasta id.To best
illustate the usage, the sequence file is downsampled.
